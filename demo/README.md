# Demos

Demos here are minimal demos that are designed to be run locally and not deployed through dokku.

Like bundles, they are split to individual repos (so that CI can run), and could be deployed, but it's a bit tricky because of the .git directories in the survos package.

Perhaps someday the dokku sites will be deployed directly from github actions.

For local testing, we should use the secrets vault.
