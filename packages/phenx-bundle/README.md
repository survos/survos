# PhenxBundle

The Web-based PhenX Toolkit currently receives funding from the National Institutes of Health; official current and archived versions of the PhenX Toolkit are available at www.phenxtoolkit.org.

Uses the data from https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/resources/download in a bundle.

Used to work, but no longer does. :-(
